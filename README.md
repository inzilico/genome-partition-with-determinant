# Genome partition with determinant of LD-matrix 

## Description



## Use cases

### Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)

Following multimarker approaches in GWAS, we proposed the workflow: 

1. Get LD-matrix with $r^2$ values. 

2. Transform LD-matrix into block-diagonal one. 

3. Restore haplotypes in each block

4. Test each block, identify those ones associated significntly to phenotype.

### Other potential usages

* tagSNP selection
* demensionality reduction for machine learning approaches
